Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.",27," [THINK]Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. Trinity sells magazines at a price that is 11/8 of what she bought them for. The cost price (the price at which she bought the magazines) is given as $72. We need to find her profit.

First, I need to recall that profit is calculated as the selling price minus the cost price. So, if I can find the selling price, then I can subtract the cost price to get the profit.

The problem states that the selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. So, if the cost price is $72, then the selling price should be (11/8) times $72.

Let me calculate that. First, I'll write down the cost price (CP) as $72.

Selling price (SP) = (11/8) * CP = (11/8) * 72.

Now, to calculate this, I can first divide 72 by 8 and then multiply by 11, or multiply 72 by 11 first and then divide by 8. Let me do the division first because it might be simpler.

72 divided by 8 is 9, because 8 * 9 = 72.

So, (11/8) * 72 = 11 * (72 / 8) = 11 * 9 = 99.

So, the selling price is $99.

Now, profit is SP minus CP, so profit = 99 - 72.

Let me calculate that: 99 - 72. 99 - 70 = 29, and 29 - 2 = 27. So, profit is $27.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 72 divided by 8 is indeed 9, because 8 * 9 = 72. Then 11 * 9 is 99, which is correct. Then 99 - 72 is indeed 27.

Is there anything else to consider? The problem seems straightforward. Profit is indeed selling price minus cost price, and the selling price is given as a fraction of the cost price.

I think that's all. The profit should be $27.

But just to make sure, maybe I can calculate it another way. For example, the ratio of selling price to cost price is 11/8, so the profit is SP - CP = (11/8)CP - CP = (11/8 - 1)CP = (3/8)CP.

Because 11/8 - 1 = 11/8 - 8/8 = 3/8.

So, profit = (3/8)*72.

Let me calculate that. 72 divided by 8 is 9, and 3 times 9 is 27. So, profit is $27 again. That confirms my previous answer.

So, I'm confident that the profit is $27.

Now, to present the answer, I'll put it in a box as requested.

Final answer: \boxed{27}[/THINK]To solve the problem, we need to find Trinity's profit from selling magazines. The cost price (CP) is given as $72, and the selling price (SP) is 11/8 of the cost price. The profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

First, we calculate the selling price:
\[
SP = \frac{11}{8} \times CP = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
\]
To simplify, we divide 72 by 8:
\[
72 \div 8 = 9
\]
Then multiply by 11:
\[
11 \times 9 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = SP - CP = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

To confirm, we can also calculate the profit as a fraction of the cost price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \left(\frac{11}{8} - 1\right) \times CP = \frac{3}{8} \times 72
\]
Dividing 72 by 8:
\[
72 \div 8 = 9
\]
Then multiply by 3:
\[
3 \times 9 = 27
\]
Both methods confirm that the profit is $27.
