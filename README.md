## Abstract

Large reasoning models trained via reinforcement learning (RL) substantially outperform their supervised counterparts on tasks requiring logic and mathematical reasoning, yet the mechanistic basis for these improvements remains unclear. We investigate this phenomenon through an integrated behavioral-mechanistic analysis of mathematical reasoning, asking: what internal differences enable RL models' superior performance?
